# Laptop Battery Health Checker (Streamlit + Random Forest)

This project is a machine learning-based battery health predictor built with Streamlit.
It uses a Random Forest Regressor trained on synthetic data (age, daily usage, charge cycles, and temperature conditions) to predict laptop battery health. The app provides both predictions and recommendations for users, along with model statistics.
